This expo project is an example of how one would use a native firebase packages (from react-native-firebase) within expo by having a custom dev client.

Watch out for:

- working apple developer account
- firebase account
- expo account
- cocoa pods explicit version in eas.json
- reCaptcha plugin reverse id
- google services files for iOS and android
- unstyled text input for sms code (my bad)
